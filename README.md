# Restaurant-Page
** The main focus of this project is to build a website (Restaurant Page in this case) that uses webpack and ES6 modules to change the DOM. The pages are static & non-responsive as the main goal was to showcase my skills & gained knowledge working with webpack. Restaurant page has got three different pages, (i.e Home, Menu & Contact). Please take note, the form does not do anything because I haven't added any functionality to it yet.
